          <p class="main-p col">Here are the facts: I'm a 16-year-old boy and I'm currently in the 10th grade. Ever since I was little, I've always been fascinated by technology and how it works. I always get in trouble with it from being on it for too long, or playing games, or watching YouTube videos when I'm supposed to be studying or doing homework. <p class="col hacker">I’ve always been a sort of <strong>hacker</strong>, in both senses of the word, I guess – I like to dink around with computers and code, but I’m also always looking for new and better ways to do things. I’m absolutely obsessed with living my life to its fullest potential!</p> <p class="col cig">My mindset and pretty the way I entire way I look at life has changed due to the high number of articles and videos I've watched on how to become a better student. Most of this info has come from Thomas Frank and his entire team at <a class="link" href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/" target="_blank">CollegeInfoGeek</a>!</p>
