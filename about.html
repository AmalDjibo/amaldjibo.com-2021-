          <p class="main-p col">Here are the facts: I'm a 18-year-old and I'm currently in the 12th grade. Ever since I was little, I've always been fascinated by computers and how they work. I always get in trouble with it from being on it for too long, or playing games, or watching YouTube videos when I'm supposed to be studying or doing homework.

I’m absolutely obsessed with living my life to its fullest potential!</p>

I am a part of a program in my school district where I go on a college campus for half the school day to learn about topics such as PC and network troubleshooting, how to prevent social engineering attacks, cloud computing, and much more! In June 2022, I earned the <a class="link" href="https://www.credly.com/badges/b123c829-c1cb-44e0-b72b-ff31d25f3f6d/public_url target="_blank">CompTIA A+</a> certification; A highly sought globally recognized entry level IT certification.</p>
